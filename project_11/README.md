## Learning objectives

The goals of this first project are to (1) get you familiarized with the course setup, and (2), explore the different properties and assumptions of linear models in a controlled environment where you have full control over the (synthetic) data generating process. In particular, you will

1. Generate synthetic data following the basic assumptions of the basic linear model with Gaussian homoscedastic errors.
2. Fit a linear model using ordinary least squares (OLS).
3. Understand the different components of the results table.
4. Obtain confidence intervals (CIs) from a fitted model.
5. Understand how CIs work and what statements can be derived from them.
6. Obtain a prediction interval from a fitted linear model.
8. Understand the difference between prediction and confidence intervals, and which statements can be derived from them.
