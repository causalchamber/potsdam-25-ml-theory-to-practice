We will go through this notebook together in class. The goal is to familiarize you with the queue system of the Causal Chamber™ Remote Lab, so you can collect your own data for subsequent tutorials.

## Additional Python dependencies

You will need the latest version of the `causalchamber` package. Install it with

```
pip install --upgrade causalchamber
```
