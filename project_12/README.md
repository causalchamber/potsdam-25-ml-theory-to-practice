# Project 1.2: Linear models and real-world data

> Posted on: 27.10.2025

> Due date: 3.11.2025 at 12:00

> Jupyter notebook: [project_12_linear_models_real.ipynb](project_12_linear_models_real.ipynb)

Please complete the notebook and submit it before the due date. You can find the submission instructions under the [Workflow](../#workflow) section of the main course page.

## Learning objectives

1. Experience how the nice things a linear model gives you (e.g., pred. intervals) only work when underlying assumptions are satisfied.
2. Understand the effect of multicollinearity on a model's estimates and how to detect it.
3. How to make statements under finite-sample effects.
3. Understand that the coefficients of a linear model do not induce causal statements, i.e., correlation does not imply causation.
4. Observe the principle of causal invariance and the minimax formulation of causality.

Each student will collect experimental data from the Light Tunnel to have a first-hand experience of the above concepts.

## Additional Python dependencies

You will need the latest version of the `causalchamber` package. Install it with

```
pip install --upgrade causalchamber
```
