Please complete the notebook and submit it before the due date. You can find the submission instructions under the [Workflow](../#workflow) section of the main course page.

## Learning objectives

1. Know how to build a simple image classifier from scratch using Pytorch
2. Analyse training & test loss curves to diagnose training failures and overfitting.
3. Be able to explain the relationship between overfitting and generalization of a model and how this relates to the bias-variance tradeoff.
4. Given a classifier, implement a two-sample test from scratch.
5. Understand the difference between level and calibration of a test.
6. Predict the how level and power of a classifier two-sample test are affected by training and generalization of the underlying classifier.

## Additional Python dependencies

You will need PyTorch for this project. Follow the [installation instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) in the official page to install the appropriate version for your hardware.
