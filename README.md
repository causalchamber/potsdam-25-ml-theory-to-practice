This is the exercise repository for the course "From ML Theory to Practice", imparted at the Universit√§t Potsdam in the fall semester of 2025. The course has been designed by Juan L. Gamella and Simon Bing.

We will use this repository to post the exercises and receive your solutions.

We assume you have a basic understanding of git. If you don't, look at this [quick guide](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) and ask us for help!

## Setup

1. **Clone this repository**

    Open your terminal, and type
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:uni-potsdam/ml-theory-to-practice.git
   ```

2. **Create a new branch for yourself using your university username**

    For example, if your username is `jdoe@uni-potsdam.de`, use:
   ```bash
   cd ml-theory-to-practice
   git checkout -b student/jdoe
   ```

4. **Create a virtual environment to hold the Python dependencies for the course**

   First, make sure you have virtualenv installed:
   ```bash
   pip install virtualenv
   ```
   
   Create a new virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m virtualenv venv
   ```

5. **Install the basic dependencies**
   
   Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
   
   Install the requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r core_requirements.txt
   ```
   
   To make sure this worked, run:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```
   This should open Jupyter Lab in your browser at [localhost:8888/lab](http://localhost:8888/lab).

## Workflow

1. For each exercise, we will post the corresponding notebook in the schedule below. You can then pull the repository to get the notebook and other files:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. If you need to install additional Python packages for a particular project, we will tell you.

3. You can now begin working inside your `student/<username>` branch, committing your changes as you go:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```

4. To submit your exercise, create a final commit with message "SUBMISSION: project xxx". Make sure to push your changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "SUBMISSION: Exercise 1"
   git push origin student/<username>
   ```
   If you add additional changes, just add them and redo the commit. We will just look at your last commit _before_ the deadline.
   **Important:** If you don't push your changes, we won't see your submission!

## FAQ

We will populate this section as the course progresses. If you have any questions, please reach out to Simon Bing.
