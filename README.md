# From ML Theory to Practice - Exercise Repository

This is the exercise repository for the course "From ML Theory to Practice", being taught at the Universit√§t Potsdam in the fall semester of 2025.

We will use this repository to post the exercises and receive your solutions.

We assume you have a basic understanding of git. If you don't, look at this [quick guide](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) and ask us for help!

## Setup

1. **Open your terminal**

2. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:uni-potsdam/ml-theory-to-practice.git
   ```

3. **Enter the repository and create a new branch for yourself using your university username:**
   ```bash
   cd ml-theory-to-practice
   git checkout -b student/<your-potsdam-username>
   ```
   For example, if your username is `jdoe@uni-potsdam.de`, use:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b student/jdoe
   ```

4. **Create a virtual environment to hold the Python dependencies for the course:**
   
   First, make sure you have virtualenv installed:
   ```bash
   pip install virtualenv
   ```
   
   Create a new virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m virtualenv venv
   ```

5. **Install the basic dependencies:**
   
   Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
   
   Install the requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r core_requirements.txt
   ```
   
   To make sure this worked, run:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```
   This should open Jupyter Lab in your browser at [localhost:8888/lab](http://localhost:8888/lab).

## Workflow

1. For each exercise, we will post the corresponding notebook in the schedule below. You can then pull the repository to get the notebook and other files:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. If you need to install additional Python packages, we will tell you.

3. You can begin working inside your `student/<username>` branch, committing your changes as you go:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```

4. To submit your exercise, create a final commit with message "SUBMISSION: [exercise name]". Make sure to push your changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "SUBMISSION: Exercise 1"
   git push origin student/<username>
   ```
   **Important:** If you don't push your changes, we won't see your submission!
